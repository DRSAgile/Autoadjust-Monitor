# Autoadjust-Monitor
A script that automatically adjusts the monitor's contrast depending on the length of the day and whether it is clear or cloudy

The script requires a preparation to work as intended.

Namely, a table file with sunrise and sunset times data for a whole year for a specific location needed. Whether the data is for a leap year or not, it should work regardless. 

Additionally, weather service might be used to adjust the monitor also depending on whether it is currently sunny or cloudy outside. 

More details are in the script itself.
